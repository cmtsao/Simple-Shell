# Simple-Unix-Shell
Created this program using a Docker container simulating a Linux environment, so the Makefile was meant for a make command in a Unix/Linux environment. 
## Simpleshell
The program includes basic built commands like exit and cd, and the shell will run other Linux commands like ls, throwing errors when appropriate. <br />
There is also support for I/O redirection and piping.
